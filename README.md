# Events Platform Backend

This is the backend for the **Events Platform** â€” a mobile-first app where users can create, discover, and join community events. Staff users can manage and oversee all events, while regular users can browse, bookmark, and sign up for events of interest.

The backend is built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, following RESTful API principles.
